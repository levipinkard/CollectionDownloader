# CollectionDownloader

Batch downloads entire collections from Thingiverse.

Author name and collection name is required.

The requests module must be installed with ```pip install requests```.

The script can be run interactively, at which time prompts occur for author name and collection name.

If the collection name does not contain spaces, it can be run directly ```python collectionscraper.py author_name collection_name```

If the collection name does include spaces, interactive mode is recommended.
